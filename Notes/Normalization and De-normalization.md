| Normal Form | Description |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1NF         | A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.                                                                    |
| 2NF         | A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key. |
| 3NF         | A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.                                          |
| 4NF         | A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.                        |
| 5NF         | A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.               |
